#Chris’ GitHub README for quote.ly <br/><br/>

##General Assembly: Project 1, Due 10/31/2014

##Overview

Quote.ly is a web application that provides users with tailored daily quotes. Users can choose the category of the quotes they wish to receive - quotes are sourced from TheySaidSo’s API. Users can save their favorite quotes to a ‘My Favs’ list, in addition to adding quotes of their own. Please sign up for full functionality, as back-end authentication was a focus on this project.

Quote.ly was developed for a project for the Fall 2014 Web Development Immersive (WDI)course at General Assembly. It was developed over a week-long sprint to model the agile software development process.

##Technologies Used
* Ruby 2.1.3
* Rails 4.1.6
* PostgreSQL Database
* Authentication & Authorization from scratch using [b-crypt-ruby](http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/ "bcrypt-ruby")
* [TheySaidSo API](http://theysaidso.com/api#) & [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty "HTTParty")
* Testing using [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails), [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), and [factory_girl_rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails)
